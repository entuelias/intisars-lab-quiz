Data Structures and Algorithms Exam in Python
This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python.

Contents
Number Search is A Python program that prompts the user to enter a sequence of numbers into an array and a number to be searched. The program determines if the number is present in the array and, if so, displays the number of times it appears.
Stack Implementation is A Python code snippet that implements a stack using arrays, including push and pop operations.
Queue Implementation is A python implementation of a linear queue data structure using two stacks (as implemented in the Stack Implementation), where the stacks are implemented using arrays. The implementation provides functionality for enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations, adhering to the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
Bubble Sort is A Python implementation of the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array of alphabets (ASCII).
Merge Sort is A Python implementation of the merge sort algorithm to sort the numbers entered in the Number Search program.
Element Deletion is A python method named deleteElement that takes an array and an integer representing the index of the element to delete. The method deletes the element at the specified index from the array and returns the modified array. If the index is invalid (less than 0 or greater than or equal to the array length), the method prints “Invalid index.” and returns the original array unchanged.
